# A test that only uses sources that perform random updates when idling (both benign and malicious).
# This file only uses the 10KHz versions.
# Results from one RNG seed: approx. 90% sensitivity, perfect specificity.
# All the sensitivity issues arise with the 'tx' benchmarks, which makes sense,
# especially when the program is writing a '1'.

[Source Settings]
# For each dataset you wish to use, add a line with the following format:
# sourcename: class, training_proportion, training_weight, testing_weight

# "sourcename" should be the name of the source. Examples: "astar", "ff-test-10000"

# "class" should be "good", "0", or "false" for benign classes and "bad", "1", or "true" for malicious classes.

# "training_proportion" should be a float between 0 and 1 representing how the class's samples are split.
#   A training proportion of 0 means that all samples are used for TESTING (none for training).
#   A training proportion of 1 means that all samples are used for TRAINING (none for testing).

# "training_weight" is an int representing the proportion that each class will be used in training.
#   For example, if astar has a training weight of 2 and bzip2 has a weight of 1, then astar samples
#   will be using for training twice as often as the bzip2 samples.
#   Also, note that benign and malicious classes will have their proportions handled separately.
#   The ratio of benign to malicious classes used in training/testing is in the [Experiment Settings] section.

# "testing_weight" is the same as training weight, but for sampling during testing phases.

# Example: astar = good, 0.5, 2, 1
ru-benign = good, 0.9, 9, 9

ru-fr-tx-10000 = bad, 0.5, 1, 1
ru-fr-rx-10000 = bad, 0.5, 1, 1
ru-fr-test-10000 = bad, 0.5, 1, 1
ru-ff-tx-10000 = bad, 0.5, 1, 1
ru-ff-rx-10000 = bad, 0.5, 1, 1
ru-ff-test-10000 = bad, 0.5, 1, 1
ru-pp-tx-10000 = bad, 0.5, 1, 1
ru-pp-rx-10000 = bad, 0.5, 1, 1
ru-pp-test-10000 = bad, 0.5, 1, 1

# If this value is set to 1, samples are used as they are, with no modifications.

# So, if n=2 and there are 5 samples, 4 new samples will be created using the sample sets {0,1}, {1,2}, {2,3}, and {3,4} as input.
# Also, it only makes sense to set this above 1 when using a dataset that has all of its samples ordered such that the end timestamp of sample n is the start timestamp of sample n+1.

[Datapoint Blacklist]
# If you want a datapoint deliberately removed from the training/testing input, add it here.
# You don't need to add an equals sign or anything.
# Example list:
# cpu.iew.memOrderViolationEvents
# cpu.decode.runCycles
# NOTE: you can also list the first part of a datapoint to exclude all datapoints that start with it.
# For example, listing only "cpu" will exclude all cpu-related datapoints.

# I usually remove these datapoints since they involve specific RAM banks and tend to cause overfitting.

[Datapoint Whitelist]
# Same rules as the above list, including the shorthand for capturing groups of datapoints.
